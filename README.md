## Description
What's Up Doc is a MERN (MongoDB, Express JS, React, Node JS) Stack application that functions as a one-stop shop for users looking to find a doctor, book an appointment, or refill and pay for a subscription.

Using React as a dynamic front end platform, and GraphQL to easily handle a number of server-side client requests, What's Up Doc is designed to be intuitive to use and flexible to maintain, providing ease of use for both the patient and the provider.
