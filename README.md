## Description
What's Up Doc is a MERN (MongoDB, Express JS, React, Node JS) Stack application that functions as a one-stop shop for users looking to find a doctor, book an appointment, or refill and pay for a subscription.

Using React as a dynamic front end platform, and GraphQL to easily handle a number of server-side client requests, What's Up Doc is designed to be intuitive to use and flexible to maintain, providing ease of use for both the patient and the provider.

## Usage
Upon signing up for What's Up Doc, a user can:
 - search through a list of doctors, add a new one, and remove their current doctor
 - book an appointment based on a list of procedures
 - refill their current subscription, and pay through the integrated Stripe payment platform

On the server-side, a medical provider can:
 - keep an up-to-date list of their users
 - provide a fresh roster of doctors to choose from
 - provide a user with prescription based on their procedure selection

As a user who is looking for a doctor or appointment, I want to use a single web application so that I can keep track of and update my medical information/needs.

When I reach the homepage, I am asked to login.
When I create my profile, I am given the option of being assigned a hospital based on my location, or picking one, and am granted access to the rest of the website.
When I search for a doctor, then I am able to add, update, or remove my doctor.
When I search for a procedure, then I am presented with a list to choose from, which I can add to my profile.
When I add a procedure, then I am presented with a list of appointments to choose from.
When I add a procedure or appointment, then I am assigned a prescription.
When I click on my prescription, then I am taking to a payment page to pay for the prescription.
When I click on my profile page, then I am able to update or delete my doctor, appointment, procedure, hospital, or prescription information.
