# Whats-Up-Doc

As a user who is looking for a doctor or appointment, I want to use a single web application so that I can keep track of and update my medical information/needs.

When I reach the homepage, I am asked to login.
When I create my profile, I am given the option of being assigned a hospital based on my location, or picking one, and am granted access to the rest of the website.
When I search for a doctor, then I am able to add, update, or remove my doctor.
When I search for a procedure, then I am presented with a list to choose from, which I can add to my profile.
When I add a procedure, then I am presented with a list of appointments to choose from.
When I add a procedure or appointment, then I am assigned a prescription.
When I click on my prescription, then I am taking to a payment page to pay for the prescription.
When I click on my profile page, then I am able to update or delete my doctor, appointment, procedure, hospital, or prescription information.
